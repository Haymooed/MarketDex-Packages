# 🎉 Funhouse Package

Bring some lighthearted fun to your BallsDex bot with celebratory slash commands.

## ✨ Features
- `/fortune` delivers a playful fortune in an embed (ephemeral by default, public on request).
- `/cheer` sends an upbeat cheer for a user or yourself with vibrant styling.
- `/confetti` decorates the channel with a mini celebration and seasonal emoji flair.

## 🚀 Usage
1. Drop the `Funhouse` folder into your bot's packages directory.
2. Reload or restart your bot to load the new cog.
3. Run `/fortune`, `/cheer`, or `/confetti` in a server where the bot is present.

## ⚙️ Notes
- All commands are server-only (no DMs) to keep the celebration in-guild.
- `/fortune` supports a `share` option if you want to post the result publicly.
