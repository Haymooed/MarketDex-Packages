# 💸 Flex Package  
A simple (and extremely necessary) way to flex your hard-earned balls in your Dex.

Show off your rarest pulls, your day-one shinies, your admin-gifted monstrosities (we don’t judge), and let everyone know you’re *built different*.

---

## ✨ Purpose of This Package

The Flex Package adds:

- `/flex` — show off your top balls  
- `/flex top` — display your best stats  
- `/flex compare` — compare your Dex with another user  
- Extra cosmetic swag for leaderboard grinders  
- A foundation to build future “vanity” features

(All commands listed above are **planned**, not yet implemented.)
